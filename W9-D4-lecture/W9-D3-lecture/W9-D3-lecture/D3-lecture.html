            <h4>No overflow set</h4>
            <p>Donkey: Let me get this straight. You're gonna go fight a dragon, and rescue a princess just so Farquaad will give you back a swamp, which you only don't have because he filled it full of freaks in the first place. Is that about right?
                Shrek: You know what? Maybe there's a good reason donkeys shouldn't talk.

        <h4>Overflow set to hidden</h4>
            <p>Donkey: I don't get it, Shrek. Why don't you just pull some of that ogre stuff on him? Throttle him, lay siege to his fortress, grind his bones to make your bread, the whole ogre trip.
                Shrek: Oh, I know what. Maybe I could have decapitated an entire village, and put their heads on a pike, gotten a knife, cut open their spleen and drink their fluids. Does that sound good to you?

                Donkey: Uh, no, not really, no.
                Shrek: For your information, there's a lot more to ogres than people think.
                Donkey: Example?
                Shrek: Example? Okay, um, ogres are like onions.
                Donkey: [Sniffs] They stink?
                Shrek: Yes-- No!
                Donkey: They make you cry?
                Shrek: No!
                Donkey: You leave them out in the sun, they get all brown, start sproutin' little white hairs.
                Shrek: No! Layers! Onions have layers. Ogres have layers! Onions have layers. You get it? We both have layers.

            <h4>Overflow set to x hidden and y scroll</h4>
            <p>Donkey: Oh, you both have layers. Oh. [Sniffs] You know, not everybody likes onions. Cakes! Everybody loves cakes! Cakes have layers.
                Shrek: I don't care what everyone likes. Ogres. Are not. Like cakes.
                Donkey: You know what else everybody likes? Parfaits. Have you ever met a person, you say, "Hey, let's get some parfait," they say, "Hell no, I don't like no parfait"? Parfaits are delicious.</p>

            <p>Shrek: You know, I think preferred your humming.
                Donkey: Do you have a tissue or something? I'm making a mess. Just the word parfait makes me start slobbering.
                Shrek: Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you'd be dead. [Sniffs] It's brimstone. We must be getting close.
                Donkey: Yeah, right, brimstone. Don't be talking about it's the brimstone. I know what I smell. It wasn't no brimstone. It didn't come off no stone either.

                Shrek: Sure, it's big enough, but look at the location. [Laughing]
                Donkey: Shrek? Remember when you said ogres have layers?
                Shrek: Oh, aye.
                Donkey: Well, I have a bit of a confession to make. Donkeys don't have layers. We wear our fear right out there on our sleeves.
                Shrek: Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves.
                Donkey: You know what I mean.
                Shrek: You can't tell me you're afraid of heights?
